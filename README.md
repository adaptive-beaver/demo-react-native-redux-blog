# React Native Redux with CRUD operations

In the <a href="https://medium.com/@mosesesan/tutorial-react-native-redux-boilerplate-4899f5c4f431">previous</a> tutorial, we created a basic React Native app that uses Redux to display information stored in the Redux store, our data was stored in a json file that was accessed every time the <strong>getData</strong> function is called. For this tutorial, I will be transforming the app to a Quotes app, that allows the user to <strong>add</strong>, <strong>view</strong>, <strong>update</strong> and <strong>delete</strong> quotes, in order to achieve this, I will be adding CRUD operations.
